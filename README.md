## Ping-Pong ##

To start off our first week of Ruby, write a Ruby method on the Fixnum class that takes a number from the user and returns a list of numbers and strings that corresponds to the Ping-Pong solution (i.e., 7.pingpong() returns [1, 2, "ping", 4, "pong", "ping", 7]). This is a little similar to the "Beep Boop" application you constructed back in Intro to Programming.

Write plain English versions of your specs, in the order you'd implement them. Here is the first one to get you started:


|Specification|Input|Output|
|-|-|-|
|returns an array from 1 through the number inputted|7|[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]|
|and, returns number divisible by 3 as ping|3|[1,2,"ping"]|
|and, returns number divisible by 5 as pong|5|[1,2,"ping",4,"pong"]|

## Accessing IRB ##
* If you're on a Mac: open your Applications folder, then go into your Utilities folder and launch Terminal. Type irb and press Enter.
* On Windows, you'll open Rails Installer > Interactive Ruby from the Ruby section of the Start Menu.
